    -1.Never surf alone. 

    -2.Don't not expect cold water upwelling (Brrrr...). 

    -3.Always pack last minute. 

    -4.Load the truck as fast possible! 

    -5.Stay loose, bring snacks.

## The Mission:

Since you follow rule #1, you always surf with friends, and you like to go out with your friends. Now it's the next morning and the 4am alarm you enthusiastically set has gone off. It's a 90min drive to the coast and you want to be there by 5:35am. Luckily your gear is all at the house, unfortunately, the itemsyou need are strewn about in different rooms. Hurry up and load up the truck, the more you remember to bring, the more friend points you get.
